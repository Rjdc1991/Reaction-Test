# Reaction-Test

Hello World!

I have been studying front-end web development over the past year and have just discovered Github. I have designed a reaction test using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am having an issue where some of the boxes will appear below the page, causing the scroll bar to appear, and having to scroll down to see the block. This being my first project, I expect it to be something minor. Thanks!
